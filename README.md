It was part of the topic NoSQL databases imparted at the Duale Hochschule Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (DHBW) Stuttgart. With the current state of the application the default configuration of Redis was used (Standalone).

## Installation

``
mvn clean install
``

3- On the root folder of the project in order to install all dependencies regarding the fronted implementation, run:
